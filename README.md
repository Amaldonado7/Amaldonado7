I'm a frontend developer who is passionate about learning JavaScript in all its layers, creating apps using different kinds of technology, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Angular and recently I'm getting back to React side of the moon. My interest in the community ecosystem led me to become one of the directors from <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/buenosaires">Women Who Code Buenos Aires</a>, a community that inspires women to excel in technology careers.
